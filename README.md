## Build the Website

### Prepare the Build Environment

Ensure that [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) are installed. For Windows, have [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) installed as well.

The website is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Install `jekyll` and `bundler`: 

    gem install jekyll bundler

After having `bundler` installed, you can install the local packages and necessary dependencies:

    bundle

To build the tutorial viewer, install necessary nodejs modules in the `tutorials/viewer` folder:

    cd tutorials/viewer
    npm install

### Build

First, we need to build the code for the video tutorial.

    cd tutorials/viewer
    npm run build

This will generate `tutorials/viewer.bundle.js`, which is needed for displaying the video tutorials.

Then, generate the website in the root folder. For a development build, set `cdn_enabled` to `false` in `_config.yml`. For a production build, if you want to use the CDN, set `cdn_enabled` to `true` and configure `cdn_prefix`. Then you may run the following command to generate the website:

    bundle exec jekyll build

The generated website contents will be in the `_site_` folder.

For development, you can run the following command to have Jekyll watch for changes and automatically recompile the website.

    bundle exec jekyll serve -P 4001

Navigate to <http://localhost:4001/index.html> to see the website.

To debug the video tutorials, you can watch for changes too.

    cd tutorials/viewer
    npm run watch

## Where Things Are

Due to the requirements of Jekyll, we need to use multiple folders for the same kind of content. To reduce confusion, here is a list of the roles for each folder in this website.

Gallery:
- `_gallery`: Markdown files that specifies the Gallery section. Each file is a single item in the Gallery.
- `gallery`: This folder contains *only* the index page for the Gallery section.
- `images/gallery`: Image files for the gallery.

Tutorials:
- `_docs`: Markdown files that specify the Getting Started section.
- `_tutorials`: Markdown files that specify the Video Tutorials. Each file is a single tutorial.
- `tutorials`: This folder contains *only* the index page for the Tutorials section.
- `images/tutorials`: Tutorial thumbnail images.
- `videos/tutorials`: Tutorial video files.

Datasetsï¼š
- `_data/datasets.yml`: This file specifies the information for all datasets. Datasets are referenced by their `id` from the Gallery and Tutorials.

CSS stylesheets:
- `_sass`: This folders contains the SASS source file (.scss) for the stylesheets. Jekyll will compile them to css files.

Header and footer:
- `_includes`: This folder contains the `<head>`, header, and footer for the website.

Page layouts:
- `_layouts`: This folder contains the layout template files for the website, gallery, and tutorials.
