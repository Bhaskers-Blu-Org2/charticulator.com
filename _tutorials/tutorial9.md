        # Dataset & Chart

        Results from a usability study comprised of four tasks.

        In this tutorial, we display task completion time by creating a bar chart with error bars.

        # Set up the Chart

    - timeBegin: 0.00
      timeEnd: 2.60
      text: |
        Assign `Task` to the Y axis

    - timeBegin: 2.60
      timeEnd: 5.39
      text: |
        Adjust the height of the chart

        # Create a Data-Driven Guide

    - timeBegin: 5.39
      timeEnd: 15.60
      text: |
        After adding a data-driven guide to the glyph editor, add `Mean`, `LOWER`, and `UPPER` to the data-driven guide

    - timeBegin: 15.60
      timeEnd: 20.99
      text: |
        Adjust the range and position of the X axis

        # Create a Bar Glyph with an Error Bar

    - timeBegin: 20.99
      timeEnd: 24.80
      text: |
        Add a rectangle mark to the glyph

    - timeBegin: 24.80
      timeEnd: 27.40
      text: |
        Set the color of the mark to light blue

    - timeBegin: 27.40
      timeEnd: 30.49
      text: |
        Adjust the width of the chart

    - timeBegin: 30.49
      timeEnd: 42.70
      text: |
        Add three lines to draw an error bar

        # Add Labels to Show Task Time

    - timeBegin: 42.70
      timeEnd: 48.40
      text: |
        Add a text mark for the label and move it to the desired position

    - timeBegin: 48.40
      timeEnd: 55.00
      text: |
        Map `Mean` to the label's `Text` and adjust the text formatting
 
    - timeBegin: 55.00
      timeEnd: 61.20
      text: |
        Set the label's color to white and increase the font size

    - section: |
        # Adjust the Gap

    - timeBegin: 61.20
      timeEnd: 68.00
      text: |
        Adjust the gap between bars
