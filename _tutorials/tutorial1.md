        # Dataset & Chart

        The average monthly temperatures of Beijing, Caneberra, and Seattle.

        In this tutorial, we create a radial bar chart showing the average temperatures of the three cities.

    - section: |
        # Create a Bar Glyph

        The initial rectangle glyph will later become a wedge in the radial chart.

    - timeBegin: 0.00
      timeEnd: 3.10
      text: |
        Add a rectangle mark to the glyph

    - section: |
        # Create a Radial Layout

    - timeBegin: 3.10
      timeEnd: 7.03
      text: |
        Apply the circular scaffold

    - section: |
        # Map Data to the Mark and Plot Segment

    - timeBegin: 7.03
      timeEnd: 14.95
      text: |
        Map `Temperature` to `Height` and `City` to `Fill`

    - timeBegin: 15.23
      timeEnd: 20.47
      text: |
        Assign `Month` to the angular axis

    - section: |
        # Perform Final Adjustments

    - timeBegin: 20.47
      timeEnd: 30.21
      text: |
        Adjust the gaps

    - timeBegin: 30.21
      timeEnd: 35.23
      text: |
        Switch the alignment to `Top`, which aligns the bars to the outer circle

    - timeBegin: 35.23
      timeEnd: 41.23
      text: |
        Adjust the inner circle radius
