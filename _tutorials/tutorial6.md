        # Dataset & Chart

        The Fertility Rate and Life Expectancy of countries, retrieved from Gapminder.

        In this tutorial, we create a bubble chart (a variant of a scatterplot).

    - section: |
        # Create a Scatterplot

    - timeBegin: 0.00
      timeEnd: 3.40
      text: |
        Add a circle mark to the glyph editor

    - timeBegin: 3.40
      timeEnd: 11.22
      text: |
        Assign `FertilityRate` to the X axis and `LifeExpectancy` to the Y axis

    - section: |
        # Style the Chart

    - timeBegin: 11.22
      timeEnd: 19.83
      text: |
        Map `Population` to the circle size and set the range of the size to 5000

    - timeBegin: 19.83
      timeEnd: 26.38
      text: |
        Map `Region` to the circle color and add a legend to the canvas

    - timeBegin: 26.38
      timeEnd: 33.77
      text: |
        Set the circle stroke to Black with an opacity of 0.7

    - timeBegin: 33.77
      timeEnd: 40.00
      text: |
        Adjust the right margin of the chart to accommodate the legend

    - section: |
        # Finalize the Chart

    - timeBegin: 40.00
      timeEnd: 54.99
      text: |
        Edit the chart title
