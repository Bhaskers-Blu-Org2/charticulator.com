        # Dataset & Chart

        Boston weather data collected from the National Centers for Environmental Information.

        In this tutorial, we create a radial chart showing the temperature and precipitation in Boston for a year.

        # Create a Data-Driven Guide

    - timeBegin: 0.00
      timeEnd: 3.00
      text: |
        Add a data-driven guide to the glyph editor

    - timeBegin: 3.00
      timeEnd: 8.09
      text: |
        Add `Avg. Temperature`, `Min. Temperature`, and `Max. Temperature` to the data-driven guide

    - section: |
        # Create the Glyph

    - timeBegin: 8.09
      timeEnd: 12.31
      text: |
        Add a line mark, anchoring from the minimum tempearture to the maximum temperature

    - section: |
        # Arrange the Glyphs in a Radial Layout

    - timeBegin: 12.31
      timeEnd: 14.99
      text: |
        Apply a circular scaffold to the chart canvas
    
    - timeBegin: 14.99
      timeEnd: 17.90
      text: |
        Arrange the glyphs along the angular axis

    - section: |
        # Style the Glyphs

    - timeBegin: 17.90
      timeEnd: 28.83
      text: |
        Map `Avg. Temperature` to the line color and configure the color scale for temperature

    - timeBegin: 28.83
      timeEnd: 35.07
      text: |
        Adjust the inner radius and outer radius

    - section: |
        # Add a Circle Mark to the Glyph

        The circle mark will represent precipitation.

    - timeBegin: 35.07
      timeEnd: 45.90
      text: |
        Add a circle mark to the glyph, anchoring to the average temperature

    - timeBegin: 45.90
      timeEnd: 55.20
      text: |
        Map `Precipitation` to the circle size and set the range of the size to 3000

    - timeBegin: 55.20
      timeEnd: 67.70
      text: |
        Set the color of circles to light Blue

    - section: |
        # Style the Chart

    - timeBegin: 67.70
      timeEnd: 76.70
      text: |
        Set the colors of Axis to Gray

    - timeBegin: 76.70
      timeEnd: 84.27
      text: |
        Anchor the top of the text to the center of the chart and adjust the top margin of the chart

    - timeBegin: 84.27
      timeEnd: 94.10
      text: |
        Change the font family and font color

    - section: |
        # Finalize the Chart

    - timeBegin: 94.10
      timeEnd: 101.27
      text: |
        Change the chart size

    - timeBegin: 101.27
      timeEnd: 104.99
      text: |
        Adjust the top margin of the chart
